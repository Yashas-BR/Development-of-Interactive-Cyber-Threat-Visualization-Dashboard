# Development-of-Interactive-Cyber-Threat-Visualization-Dashboard
Project Title: Development of Interactive Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard


 Project Statement: This project focuses on developing an interactive, data-driven dashboard that provides cybersecurity analysts with immediate, visual understanding of the threat landscape. By aggregating and visualizing simulated security incident data (e.g., from CVE feeds or attack logs), the solution will clarify attack patterns, track temporal trends, and identify geographical and systemic hotspots. This enhancement will enable more proactive risk mitigation, efficient resource allocation, and improved security posture by highlighting the most vulnerable areas.


 Outcomes:
Geospatial Risk Mapping: Instantly locate and visualize the geographical origins and targets of cyber incidents on a global map.
Trend and Anomaly Detection: Provide clear time-series analysis to identify spikes, seasonality, and unusual changes in attack frequency and severity.
Vulnerability Prioritization: Use hierarchical charts to quickly identify the most frequently targeted systems or MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
Enhanced Reporting: Produce data-driven, executive-ready reports on the current organizational risk profile.


 Modules to be Implemented:
Module 1: Data Acquisition and Structuring: Collect and clean raw security incident data. Normalize fields to enable consistent analysis and mapping to MITRE ATT&CK categories.
Module 2: Core Visualization Development: Develop all time-series and categorical charts that quantify attack frequency, severity, and type distribution.
Module 3: Geospatial and Hierarchical Visualization: Implement the interactive geographical map for risk mapping and the treemap/sunburst chart for systemic vulnerability analysis.
Module 4: Dashboard Integration and Finalization: Integrate all visualizations into a single, responsive Plotly/Dash application and add interactive filtering capabilities.
